# HTML and CSS Projects

This is a display of sample projects that I made using HTML and CSS

## Projects
<ul>
<li><a href="./Project/index.html">Space Station Site </a></li><br>
<li><a href="./Basic_HTML_and_CSS/bootstrap4_project/academy_cinemas.html">Movie Theater Site </a></li><br>
<li><a href="./Basic_HTML_and_CSS/Cryptozoology Website/one_page_website.html"> Cryptozoology Site </a></li><br>
</ul>

### Space Station Site

This page is an example home page for a Space travel company. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

### Movie Theater Site

This page is an example home page for a movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components including, but not limited to
a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns. 

### Cryptozoology Site

The cryptozoology website was mostly about having fun while learning how to put together a one page website. It contains many of the same structural elements as the Space Station
Site does.
