                <td>One person counts to one hundred while having their eyes closed. The other participants scatter about the pool. 
                    Once the counter reaches one hundred they remain with their eyes closed and yell "Marco" while the other participants 
                    return by yelling out "Polo". Upon hearing the others yell "Polo" the counter tries to find them while remaining with their eyes closed.

                <td>Being a fast, stealthy swimmer. Having good hearing.</td>

                <td>Colors</td>
                <td>3</td>
                <td> One person must be "it" while two people are on either side of them. While it has their ears plugged and eyes closed, the other two decide on a color.
                    Once they have decided on a color they let "it" know that they can start guessing which color was chosen, while being held at the top of the water by the other participants. 
                    Wrong answers cause "it" to be dipped backward in the pool. The right answer causes "it" to be dunked. After "it" gets dunked there is a new it and the process repeats.
